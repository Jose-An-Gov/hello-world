# hello-world
This is my first GitHub repository

I am am doing changes to the README file to see how changes are reflected.
I am going to write facts about me:
- 23 years old
- Born on August 4th 1999 in Puebla, Mex.
- Like to play tennis
- Have a sister
- Raised in Tehuac√°n

This is the second change I make. I wank to see how you can add multiple changes to the same commit.
I also want to see how to make different commits and put them in the same pull request.


I am going to try and do a second commit for the same pull request.

Third commit but leaving the previous branch.
